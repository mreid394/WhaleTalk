# WhaleTalk

Take a phrase like "Hello, I am a Whale!" and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: .

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

- There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
- The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
- Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
